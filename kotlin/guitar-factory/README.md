# **Guitar Factory**

## **Overview**

This project implements a **custom guitar factory system** that allows users to flexibly create personalized guitars by specifying attributes such as **type, model, specifications, and operating system (OS)**. It also includes an **inventory management system**, tracking available guitars and their quantities.

The project utilizes the **Builder Pattern** to streamline guitar creation with flexibility and readability and uses a **Singleton Pattern** for centralized, consistent inventory management.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Kotlin** → Modern JVM-based language with concise syntax and strong type safety.
- **Gradle** → Build automation tool for Kotlin projects.
- **JDK 21** → Required to run the application.

---

## **Features**

- **Flexible Guitar Creation** → Users specify guitar attributes dynamically.
- **Inventory Management** → Tracks available guitars and stock levels.
- **Builder Pattern** → Simplifies the creation of guitars through a fluent interface.
- **Singleton Inventory** → Ensures centralized and consistent stock control.
- **Scalability** → Easily extendable to accommodate additional guitar attributes.

        - String model
        - String specs
        - String os
        + guitarType(type: String): GuitarBuilder
        + model(model: String): GuitarBuilder
        + specs(specs: String): GuitarBuilder
        + os(os: String): GuitarBuilder
        + build(): Guitar
    }

    class GuitarInventory {
        + addGuitar(guitar: Guitar, quantity: Int)
        + removeGuitar(guitar: Guitar, quantity: Int)
        + listInventory()
    }

    GuitarBuilder --> Guitar: builds
    GuitarInventory --> Guitar: manages
```

## **Builder Pattern**

The **Builder Pattern** simplifies creating guitars with various attributes without needing separate subclasses for each guitar type. It provides a fluent API that:

- **Allows chaining methods** to set guitar attributes (`type`, `model`, `specs`, `os`).
- **Encapsulates construction logic** within the `GuitarBuilder`, separating it from the `Guitar` class itself.
- **Produces immutable `Guitar` instances** after calling the `build()` method.

---

## **Singleton Pattern**

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures a single, consistent inventory system (`GuitarInventory`) is available throughout the application's lifecycle. This prevents inconsistencies and duplicate inventories, ensuring that all operations (add, remove, list) interact with the same shared data source.
