# Project Euler Problems in Kotlin

This repository contains solutions to mathematical and computational problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in Kotlin.

Each solution aims for clarity, efficiency, and correctness. Feel free to explore, run, and contribute!

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** – Modern JVM-based language with functional programming features and null safety
- **Gradle** – Build automation tool
- **JDK 21** – Required to run the application

---

## Structure

- Each Project Euler problem is implemented in a separate file under `src/main/kotlin/com/rbleggi/euler/`
- Each file contains:
  - A function solving the problem
  - A main method demonstrating usage
  - Comments explaining the solution where needed

## Project Euler Problems

This repository is dedicated to solving problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems. Each solution is written in Kotlin and aims to be clear and efficient.

Example problems solved:
- Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
- Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
- More problems will be added over time.
