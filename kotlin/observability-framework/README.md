# Observability Framework

## Overview

This project implements a simple and extensible framework for latency observability using the **Strategy Pattern** in Kotlin. It allows you to define different latency calculation strategies and manage multiple metric trackers flexibly.

## Features

- **Latency Strategies** → Easily calculate latency in milliseconds or nanoseconds.
- **Strategy Pattern** → Add new calculation strategies by implementing the `LatencyStrategy` interface.
- **Metrics Management** → Create, retrieve, and reset named latency trackers.
- **Extensible** → Add new strategies or metric types without changing the core framework.

    class NanosecondsLatencyStrategy {

    }

    class LatencyTracker {
        -latencies: MutableList~Long~
        +recordLatency(startTime: Long, endTime: Long): Unit
        +getAverageLatency(): Double
        +getAllLatencies(): List~Long~
    }

    class MetricManager {
        +getTracker(name: String, strategy: LatencyStrategy): LatencyTracker
        +resetTracker(name: String): Unit
        +getAllTrackerNames(): List~String~
    }

    LatencyStrategy <|-- MillisecondsLatencyStrategy
    LatencyStrategy <|-- NanosecondsLatencyStrategy
    LatencyTracker o-- LatencyStrategy: uses
    MetricManager o-- LatencyTracker: manages

## Strategy Pattern

The **Strategy Pattern** allows defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating them, and making them interchangeable. In this project:

- Each latency calculation strategy is implemented as a class that implements `LatencyStrategy`.
- The `LatencyTracker` receives a strategy and uses it to calculate the latency of each recorded operation.
- The `MetricManager` manages multiple latency trackers, each potentially using a different strategy.
- New strategies can be added without modifying the existing code.
