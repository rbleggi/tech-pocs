# Ninety-Nine Scala Problems

## Overview

This project contains solutions to the classic **99 Scala Problems**, a set of exercises designed to improve proficiency with Scala and functional programming. Each problem is implemented in its own file, with clear comments and explanations.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Scala 3** – Modern JVM-based language with advanced type safety and functional programming features
- **SBT** – Scala's official build tool
- **JDK 21** – Required to run the application

---

## Structure

- Each problem is implemented in a separate file under `src/main/scala/com/rbleggi/ninetynine/`
- Each file contains:
  - A function solving the problem
  - A main method demonstrating usage
  - Detailed comments explaining the solution
