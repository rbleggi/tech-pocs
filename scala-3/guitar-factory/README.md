# **Guitar Builder System**

## **Overview**

This project implements a **custom guitar builder system** that allows users to flexibly create personalized guitars by
specifying attributes such as **type, model, specifications, and operating system (OS)**. It also includes an *
*inventory management system**, tracking available guitars and their quantities.

The project utilizes the **Builder Pattern** to streamline guitar creation with flexibility and readability and uses a *
*Singleton Pattern** for centralized, consistent inventory management.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Scala 3.6** → Modern JVM-based language with functional programming support.
- **SBT** → Scala's build tool for managing dependencies and compiling code.
- **JDK 21** → Required for running the application.

---

## **Features**

- **Flexible Guitar Creation** → Users specify guitar attributes dynamically.  
- **Inventory Management** → Tracks available guitars and stock levels.  
- **Builder Pattern** → Simplifies the creation of guitars through a fluent interface.  
- **Singleton Inventory** → Ensures centralized and consistent stock control.  
- **Scalability** → Easily extendable to accommodate additional guitar attributes.

## **Class Diagram**

The following diagram illustrates the updated structure using the **Builder Pattern**:

    class Guitar {
        - Guitar(type, model, specs, os)
        + String guitarType
        + String model
        + String specs
        + String os
        + toString(): String
    }

    class Builder {
        - String guitarType
        - String model
        - String specs
        - String os
        + guitarType(type: String): Builder
        + model(model: String): Builder
        + specs(specs: String): Builder
        + os(os: String): Builder
        + build(): Guitar
    }

    class GuitarInventory {
        + addGuitar(guitar: Guitar, quantity: Int)
        + removeGuitar(guitar: Guitar, quantity: Int)
        + listInventory()
    }

    Builder --> Guitar: builds
    GuitarInventory --> Guitar: manages
```

## **Builder Pattern**

The **Builder Pattern** simplifies creating guitars with various attributes without needing separate subclasses for each
guitar type. It provides a fluent API that:

1. **Allows chaining methods** to set guitar attributes (`type`, `model`, `specs`, `os`).
2. **Encapsulates construction logic** within the `GuitarBuilder`, separating it from the `Guitar` class itself.
3. **Produces immutable `Guitar` instances** after calling the `build()` method.

---

## **Singleton Pattern**

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures a single, consistent inventory system (`GuitarInventory`) is available throughout the
application's lifecycle. This prevents inconsistencies and duplicate inventories, ensuring that all operations (add,
remove, list) interact with the same shared data source.
