# **Task ThreadPool Framework**

## **Overview**

A modular Scala 3 PoC for concurrent task execution using a custom thread pool, inspired by the class-organizer and social-media-photo-app project standards. Demonstrates core features (task submission, thread pool management, graceful shutdown) and extensibility for real-world concurrent workloads.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Scala 3** → Modern JVM-based language with functional programming support.
- **SBT** → Scala's official build tool.
- **JDK 21** → Required to run the application.

---

## **Features**

- **Task Submission** → Submit tasks for concurrent execution
- **Thread Pool Management** → Custom thread pool with configurable workers
- **Graceful Shutdown** → Safe pool shutdown and task completion
- **Simple API** → Minimal, extensible interface for real-world use
- **Easily Extensible** → Add new task types or pool strategies without changing core logic

    class Task {
        <<trait>>
        +run(): Unit
    }

    class TaskThreadPool {
        -workers: List[Worker]
        -taskQueue: Queue[Task]
        +submit(task: Task): Unit
        +shutdown(): Unit
    }

    class Worker {
        -thread: Thread
        +start(): Unit
    }

    TaskThreadPool o-- Worker
    TaskThreadPool o-- Task
    Worker --> Task : executes
```

## **Thread Pool Pattern**

The **Thread Pool Pattern** enables efficient, reusable management of concurrent tasks. Tasks are submitted to a queue and executed by a fixed set of worker threads, improving resource usage and throughput for parallel workloads.
