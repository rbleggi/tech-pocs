# **Logistic Pricing**

## **Overview**

This project implements a **modular and extensible freight pricing system** using the **Strategy Pattern**. Freight
costs are dynamically calculated based on factors like **volume, size, and transport type** — such as **Truck**, **Rail
**, or **Boat** — with prices subject to **real-time variability**.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Scala 3.6** → Modern JVM-based language with functional programming support.
- **SBT** → Scala's official build tool.
- **JDK 21** → Required to run the application.

---

## **Features**

- **Strategy-Based Price Calculation** → Easily plug in new pricing models
- **Supports Multiple Transport Types** → Truck, Rail, Boat
- **Dynamic Pricing** → Pricing logic is fully decoupled and runtime-driven
- **Extensible Design** → Add more transport strategies without touching core logic
- **Minimal Boilerplate** → No builder classes or verbose configuration

## **Strategy Pattern**

Using the **Strategy Pattern**, the pricing logic is abstracted away from the core calculator:

1. Each transport mode implements its own `PricingStrategy`.
2. `FreightCalculator` delegates calculation to the selected strategy.
3. Easily swap or update strategies at runtime.
4. No need to modify core logic when adding a new transport type or changing pricing logic.
