## Slide 1: Title Slide (0:00 - 0:15)

*   **(0:00 - 0:05)**: (Upbeat, professional intro music fades in and out)
*   **(0:05 - 0:10)**: "Hello everyone, and welcome to our deep dive into JSON4S in Scala 3."
*   **(0:10 - 0:15)**: "Today, we'll explore how this powerful library can streamline your JSON handling in modern Scala applications."

    Scala applications."

## Slide 2: Introduction to JSON4S (0:15 - 0:45)

*   **(0:15 - 0:20)**: "So, what exactly is JSON4S? It’s a unified JSON library for Scala that provides a consistent API over multiple JSON backends."
*   **(0:20 - 0:25)**: "This means you can switch between libraries like Jackson or Native without changing your application code."
*   **(0:25 - 0:35)**: "Key features include custom serializers for complex types, advanced JSON transformations, and robust error handling, which we’ll cover today."
*   **(0:35 - 0:45)**: "With full support for Scala 3, JSON4S is an excellent choice for building modern, type-safe applications that handle JSON with ease."

## Slide 3: Custom Serializers (0:45 - 1:30)

*   **(0:45 - 0:55)**: "Let's start with one of the most powerful features of JSON4S: custom serializers. These allow you to define exactly how your custom types are converted to and from JSON."
*   **(0:55 - 1:05)**: "Here, we have a sealed trait `Animal` with two case classes, `Dog` and `Cat`. We want to represent them in JSON with a `type` field to distinguish between them."
*   **(1:05 - 1:15)**: "The `AnimalSerializer` object extends `CustomSerializer` and defines the logic for both serialization (from an object to JSON) and deserialization (from JSON to an object)."
*   **(1:15 - 1:25)**: "As you can see in the execution result, our `Dog` object is correctly serialized to a JSON object with the `type` field, and then deserialized back into a `Dog` object."
*   **(1:25 - 1:30)**: "This gives us full control over the JSON representation of our data, which is essential for working with complex data models."

## Slide 4: Advanced JSON Transformations (1:30 - 2:15)

*   **(1:30 - 1:40)**: "JSON4S also excels at manipulating JSON data. It provides a rich set of tools for transforming, filtering, and merging JSON structures."
*   **(1:40 - 1:50)**: "In this example, we parse a JSON string and then perform several transformations. We use `transformField` to convert all field names to uppercase."
*   **(1:50 - 2:00)**: "Next, we use `filterField` to remove the 'foo' field from the JSON. This is incredibly useful for cleaning up or simplifying JSON data."
*   **(2:00 - 2:10)**: "We can also merge two JSON objects together, with the fields from the first object taking precedence. And we can even compute the difference between two JSON objects."
*   **(2:10 - 2:15)**: "These powerful transformation tools make it easy to work with complex and varied JSON data."

## Slide 5: Error Handling & Type Safety (2:15 - 3:00)

*   **(2:15 - 2:25)**: "Type safety is a cornerstone of Scala, and JSON4S provides excellent support for it. It offers robust error handling mechanisms to safely extract and validate JSON data."
*   **(2:25 - 2:35)**: "Here, we demonstrate how to handle optional values using `Option` types. If a field is null or missing, it will be deserialized as `None`."
*   **(2:35 - 2:45)**: "For safe extraction, we can use `extractOpt`, which returns an `Option` of the extracted value. This prevents exceptions if the field is missing or has the wrong type."
*   **(2:45 - 2:55)**: "For more complex scenarios, we can use a `try-catch` block to handle `MappingException`, which is thrown when JSON data doesn’t match the expected structure."
*   **(2:55 - 3:00)**: "These features ensure that your application can handle unexpected or invalid JSON data gracefully."

## Slide 6: Performance & Integration (3:00 - 3:45)

*   **(3:00 - 3:10)**: "Performance is critical in many applications, and JSON4S provides options to optimize it. You can use `compact` rendering for fast, minimal JSON output."
*   **(3:10 - 3:20)**: "For debugging or logging, `pretty` rendering provides human-readable JSON. For large files, you can use `JsonParser.parse` with a stream to avoid loading the entire file into memory."
*   **(3:20 - 3:30)**: "JSON4S also integrates seamlessly with popular HTTP frameworks like Akka HTTP, Play, and http4s, making it easy to build web services."
*   **(3:30 - 3:45)**: "The code examples show how to serialize a case class for an HTTP response and how to parse a large JSON file from a stream, demonstrating the flexibility of the library."

## Slide 7: Conclusion & Resources (3:45 - 5:00)

*   **(3:45 - 3:55)**: "In summary, JSON4S is a powerful and flexible library for working with JSON in Scala 3. It provides custom serializers, advanced transformations, and robust error handling."
*   **(3:55 - 4:05)**: "The key features we've covered today - custom serializers for ADTs, powerful JSON transformations, type-safe extraction, and performance optimization - make JSON4S an excellent choice for modern Scala applications."
*   **(4:05 - 4:15)**: "We encourage you to explore the official documentation, check out the source code on GitHub, and consult the Scala 3 migration guide for more information."
*   **(4:15 - 4:25)**: "JSON4S integrates seamlessly with popular frameworks and provides the flexibility you need to handle complex JSON processing requirements in your applications."
*   **(4:25 - 4:35)**: "Whether you're building web services, processing large datasets, or working with complex data models, JSON4S provides the tools you need for reliable JSON handling."
*   **(4:35 - 4:50)**: "The library's comprehensive error handling, performance optimization features, and Scala 3 compatibility make it a solid foundation for any JSON-intensive application."
*   **(4:50 - 5:00)**: "Thank you for your time, and I'm now happy to answer any questions you may have."

## Slide 7: JSON4S vs Other Scala JSON Libraries (3:00 - 3:45)

*   **(3:00 - 3:10)**: "Now let's see how JSON4S compares to other popular Scala JSON libraries. This comparison table shows JSON4S alongside Circe, Play JSON, uPickle, and Spray JSON across key criteria."
*   **(3:10 - 3:20)**: "JSON4S shines in ease of use and ecosystem support. While Circe offers better type safety and performance, it has a steeper learning curve. Play JSON is comparable but more framework-specific."
*   **(3:20 - 3:30)**: "Choose JSON4S when you need rapid development, legacy code migration, or complex JSON transformations. It's particularly good for teams new to functional programming."
*   **(3:30 - 3:40)**: "Consider alternatives like Circe when maximum performance is critical or when you need compile-time safety guarantees for mission-critical applications."
*   **(3:40 - 3:45)**: "JSON4S offers about 20% slower parsing than Circe but provides excellent developer productivity and a unified API across different backends."
