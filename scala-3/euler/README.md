# Project Euler Problems in Scala

This repository contains solutions to mathematical and computational problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in Scala.

Each solution aims for clarity, efficiency, and correctness. Feel free to explore, run, and contribute!

---

## Tech Stack

- **Scala 3** – Modern JVM-based language with advanced type safety and functional programming features
- **SBT** – Scala's official build tool
- **JDK 21** – Required to run the application

---

## Structure

- Each Project Euler problem is implemented in a separate file under `src/main/scala/com/rbleggi/euler/`
- Each file contains:
  - A function solving the problem
  - A main method demonstrating usage
  - Comments explaining the solution

## Project Euler Problems

This repository is dedicated to solving problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems. Each solution is written in Scala and aims to be clear and efficient.

Example problems solved:
- Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
- Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
- More problems will be added over time.
